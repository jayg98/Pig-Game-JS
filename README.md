# Pig-Game-JS

Pig is a simple dice game which in its basic form is playable with just a single die. You win by being the first player to score 100 or more points.

The rules are as follows:
  
  1. Player 1 goes first and keeps pressing the "Roll Dice" button and scores as many points as possible, unless they roll a 1.
  2. If a 1 is rolled on the die, that player's turn is over and they lose all their current points and it is the next player's turn. 
  3. To win, a player must score at least 100 points.
